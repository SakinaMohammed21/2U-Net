# 2U-Net
2U-Net pipeline examines MSC cultures non-invasively. One U-Net segments cell regions, other segments cell markers, and their outputs are combined to locate individual cells. After segmentation, morphometric and textural features are used to predict cell efficacy. The proposed method has potential to advance quantitative analysis of MSC cultures.
